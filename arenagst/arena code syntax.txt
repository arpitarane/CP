int main()
{
  freopen("test.in","r",stdin);    //input file
  freopen("test.out","w",stdout);    //output file
  int a,b,t,j,ans;
  scanf("%d",&t);
  for(j=1;j<=t;j++)
  {
    scanf("%d %d",&a,&b);
    ans=a+b;
    printf("case #%d: %d\n",j,ans);
  }
  return 0;
}


NOTE:
1. use int main() and return 0;
2. Dont use clrscr() and getch();
3. In case of large input(100s and 1000s of values):
   we use input and output files
   Here freopen("file_name.in","file_mode",std.in);
   this is the syntax of including file....
    
   *note: make sure that test.in(file_name.in) is downloaded and saved in the same folder wherein your code is saved.
